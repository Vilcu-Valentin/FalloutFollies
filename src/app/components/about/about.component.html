    <p>We pride ourselves on our top-notch customer service. Our team of bomb experts is available 24/7 to answer any questions you may have about our products, from "How do I arm this thing?" to "Will it make my ex regret breaking up with me?" (The answer is yes, by the way).</p>
    <p>We also believe in giving back to the community. That's why we donate a portion of our profits to support research on the effects of nuclear radiation. We may be crazy, but we're not heartless!</p>
